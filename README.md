# MysteryCollector

GitHub did not want to run the game, so I uploaded it to Unity. In my computer it is quite laggy, I think it is because I had to compress
it a lot in order for it to fit. At the beginning it was 135MB...

Hopefully you have more powerful pc than I do and you can find the items and the easter egg.

Some of the scripts I have based on his explanation. 
Others are my written with help from your slides and also the one and only - stackoverflow
